# Rule Overrides

## Purpose
This file contains project-specific overrides to global rules.
These rules take precedence over all rules in `.ai-rules/core/`.

## Overrides

### [Category Name]

- **Impact**: [What impact this has on the project]

## Notes
- Use overrides sparingly and document the reason for each override
- Consider if the override should be proposed as a change to the global rules
- Review overrides periodically to see if they are still necessary
