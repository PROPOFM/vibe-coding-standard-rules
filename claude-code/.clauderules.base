   - Learn naming conventions, directory structure, and recommended libraries
   
3. Global Architecture: `.ai-rules/core/architecture.md`
   - Understand architectural principles and patterns
   
4. Global Testing Standards: `.ai-rules/core/test-standard.md`
   - Understand testing requirements and coverage expectations
   
5. Global Security: `.ai-rules/core/security.md`
   - Learn security best practices and secret handling
   
6. Global Error Handling: `.ai-rules/core/error-handling.md`
